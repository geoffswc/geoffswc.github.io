## Workshops Home Page

The page contains an overview of my github repositories for programming and data analysis workshops at UCSF. 

## Core Workshops

Offered once per quarter. Focus is on hands on learning, with minimal lecture. These workshops are designed for participants with little or no previous programming experience. For introductory workshops, UCSF library DSI uses the software carpentry tutorials. 

- Intro to Python Part 1
- Intro to Python Part 2
- Intro to SQL
- Intro to Unix
- Intro to Version Control with Git and GitHub

## Intermediate to Advanced Workshops

Offered once per quarter. These workshops have one or more prerequesites and are designed for participants who have previous programming experience or have completed the relevant pre-requisites above. Intermediate and advanced workshops are hands-on and involve live coding sessions. However, some more advanced material will be covered through presentation or downloads. 

- [Data Analysis with Python, Pandas, and SQL](https://github.com/geoffswc/Python-SQL-Workshop)
- Python, JSON, and Web APIs
- Python and MongoDB 
- Supervised Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn
- Document Classification with Scikit-Learn
- Text Extraction, Sentiment Analysis, and Document Classification with Google Cloud AutoML

## Electives

Offered on a rotating basis, not all electives are offered every quarter. Although all workshops involve some hands-on coding, some material will be presented through lecture, slides, or demos. These workshops often present a case study or an investigation of an interesting data set. 

- Natural Language Processing and the UCSF "No More Silence" collection. 
- CSV Repair with Python (managing poorly formatted CSV files in research).
- PySpark.ML for Classification and Regression
- Web harvesting with Python, Beautiful Soup and Scrapy
- Repeatable research with code and public datasets - Case Studies
