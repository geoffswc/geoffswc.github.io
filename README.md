## UCSF Data Science Initiative Programming Workshops

The page contains an overview of github repositories for Python, SQL, and Unix series programming and data analysis workshops at UCSF. 

The CLE links will take you to workshop page on the UCSF [CLE](http://courses.ucsf.edu) (Collaborative Learning Environment). These pages contain an overview, links, supporting material, code, and recordings of previous workshops.

The GitHub links will take you to the Git repository for a workshop. The UCSF DSI uses software carpentry material for most of the core workshops. GitHub links are available for intermediate and elective workshops developed at UCSF. 

## Core Workshops

Offered once per quarter. Focus is on hands on learning, with minimal lecture. These workshops are designed for participants with little or no previous programming experience. For introductory/core workshops, UCSF library DSI uses the software carpentry tutorials. 

- Intro to Python Part 1 ([CLE](https://courses.ucsf.edu/course/view.php?id=5281))
- Intro to Python Part 2 ([CLE](https://courses.ucsf.edu/course/view.php?id=5296))
- Intro to SQL ([CLE](https://courses.ucsf.edu/course/view.php?id=4401))
- Intro to Unix ([CLE](https://courses.ucsf.edu/course/view.php?id=5327))
- Intro to Version Control with Git and GitHub ([CLE](https://courses.ucsf.edu/course/view.php?id=5208))

## Intermediate to Advanced Workshops

Offered once per quarter. These workshops have one or more prerequesites and are designed for participants who have previous programming experience or have completed the relevant pre-requisites above. Intermediate and advanced workshops are hands-on and involve live coding sessions. However, some more advanced material will be covered through presentation or downloads.

## Electives

Offered on a rotating basis, not all electives are offered every quarter. Although all workshops involve some hands-on coding, some material will be presented through lecture, slides, or demos. These workshops often present a case study or an investigation of an interesting data set.
